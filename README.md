# MIPS32
Developed a five-stage pipelined MIPS-32 RISC processor with stages known as the Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode(ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write-Back (WB) stages.
Implemented various addressing modes including Direct Register Addressing(RR),Register Immediate Addressing(RM), Base Addressing and Relative addressing Integrated with several ALU functions.
